                        Hi! My name is Tyler Desouza. I am a college student studying computer science at Lehigh Carbon Community College. I have a strong passion for coding and problem solving, and I excel in environments where I'm required to think and solve swiftly. I always have a high-energy attitude and have proven to work well with others in teams and groups. I have over a year in customer service experience which has prompted me to get very good at properly communicating, whether that's with an individual or group. I am always open and eager to learn and adapt to new ideas. I aspire to be a full-stack software engineer and am currently learning the skills required to achieve this goal. If you'd like to talk more, please feel free to contact me!
